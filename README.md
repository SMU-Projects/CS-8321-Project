# CS-8321-Project: Final Paper

## Choosing a Topic
For the final class paper, you should investigate a topic from the course of your choosing. This topic can be related to anything we have discussed. For instance, you might choose to investigate an new implementation of GAN training with an alternative loss function (or new heuristic for training to convergence). Please do not let this example bias your choosing of a project--the topic you choose to investigate does not need to be a new algorithmic approach. It could be a new application of an algorithm we discussed. For instance, you might choose to use multi-task modeling for assessing robotic surgery. 

Any topic can be chosen from convolutional visualization, data generation (with VAE's or GANs), multi-task or multi-modal architectures, or reinforcement learning. 

While the topic can be chosen at a student's discretion, please ensure that the topic is appropriate for a final project in the course in terms of scope (not so easy that it might considered trivial, but not so hard that it might be considered a full blown research project). The right aim of scope should be such that you are investigating the initial analysis of a research topic--but there would still be much work to do for a full research publication. If you are unsure if your topic is appropriate, please email the instructor for feedback.

## Rubric
[<strong>15 Points</strong>] Use analyses and visualization to investigate your chosen topic. You have a great deal of free rein to decide what analyses you should use and therefore you will be graded on the appropriateness of the methods chosen.  When grading this, the grader will be asking: Were the analyses appropriate for what was investigated? Was the topic chosen interesting from a basic research or applied perspective?

[<strong>10 Points</strong>] Write a four page summary of your work (not including references). The format of the four page paper should be double column IEEE or ACM format. You will be graded on your writing style and academic rigor of the paper. Academic rigor is a broad term, which may include:

-Your ability to motivate your research topic given related work 
-Your ability to convey the mathematics or intuition behind a new algorithm
-Your ability to explain methodologies and motivate chosen results metrics
-Your English ability is ONLY A MINOR consideration here if you convey the correct content. However, if the English usage is so poor that it makes aspects of the research methods ambiguous, it may be considered a more major grading component. 
When grading, the grader will be asking: Did the writing of the paper properly convey why and how the research was completed? 

## What to Turn In
Turn in all codes used in your analysis and any README files for interpreting the codes. Alternatively, you may turn in a Jupyter notebook of your analysis with proper comments and explanations.

Turn in your Final paper with all team member names. The format of the submission should be PDF. You may create the PDF in any way you like: markdown, latex, word, etc. If you are using Latex or word, you might refer to the following link for templates: 

Video files may be turned in (if any) via a link to the video. For instance, videos might be referred to in your final paper as "Video Figure 1" because a video better conveys the process you used, or better shows an algorithm evolution across epochs. You are <strong>not required</strong> to make a video.
